    1.  A fixed length 2-byte header in big endian network format that gives the length of JSON header that
        follows.
    2.  Next is a serialized JSON header in Unicode text with UTF-8 encoding. The length of the JSON header
        is specified in the 2-byte integer header. The JSON header contains a dictionary of additional headers.
        One of those is content-length, which is the number of bytes of the messageâ€™s content (not including
        the JSON header).
    3.  Finally, we have the message content in the form of a dictionary. This we can modify to suit our needs.
        There several methods which manage this message stack that I did not write. They work perfectly.
    4.  This message stack enables us to have the right encoding for messages and more importantly, takes
        into account the byteorder of the machine on which it is running. Further, we are ensured that we are
        going to get the message in its entirety before we process it because we know how many bytes we are
        supposed to have.
    5.  Since reading the correct number of bytes and writing the correct number of bytes is imperative, this
        class manages all of the reading from and writing to the socket connection.
